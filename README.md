## Installation

### Using mise (Recommended)

```bash
mise use -g ubi:dkarter/lnr
```

### From Source

I have created a simple mise task to build and install from source:

```bash
mise run install
```

## Configuration

You'll need a Linear API key:

1. **Get your Linear API Key:**
   - Go to Linear Settings → API → Personal API keys
   - Create a new key

2. **Set environment variables:**

```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY='lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

Add these to your `~/.bashrc.local` or `~/.zshrc.local` to make them available in your shell and restart your shell.

And add

```bash
source ~/.zshrc.local
```

or

```bash
source ~/.bashrc.local
```

> [!WARNING]
> Important! Never commit your .local files since they may contain sensitive
> information.

## Usage

### Basic usage:

```bash
lnr
```

### tmux Integration

For a better experience, add a shell function to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# LNR form in tmux popup
lnr() {
  if [[ -n "$TMUX" ]]; then
    tmux popup -w 80% -h 80% lnr
  else
    lnr
  fi
}
```

Add a keybinding to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
bind-key "i" display-popup -E -w 80% -h 80% lnr
```

Then press `prefix + i` to open the form in a popup!

### Ghostty Integration (Optional)

Map a key in Ghostty to launch the tmux shortcut in your Ghostty config:

```ini
# Create a new linear issue
keybind = super+shift+i=text:\x1ai
```
